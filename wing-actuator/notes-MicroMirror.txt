Notes on using MicroMirror_k64f to 
1) generate high voltage usinga photoflash transformer
2) control high voltage through closed loop PWM
3) drive an array of actuators

stooped being able to compile/debug 
1. debug mcuxpresso project is currently disabled
try restart
did not work on existing projects, but debug configuration was ok on
newly imported function.

missing debug.launch file?
Got erased? Need to create new one.
Open with MCUXpresso Launch Configuration
1) Main
	C/C++ Application
		Debug\frdmk64f_hello_worldDebug\frdmk64f_hello_world.axf
2) GDB Debugger
	GDB debugger: arm-none-eabi-gdb
	non-stop mode
3) LinkServer Debugger
	Debug connection SWD
6) Startup
		Load image: use project binary
		set breakpoint at main
		request hardware breakpoint
7) Source
	Source Lookup Path: Default
8) Common
	Standard input: Allocate console

right clock on project -> Launch configurations -> create and edit new -> 
CMSIS-DAP

double click on launch file to open editor ``file does not exist''' even though opened ==> missing .axf

What to use as starting point? TactileReader.c or RaceTimer? (RaceTimer has PWM?)
Start with RaceTimer- has PWM.
In Properties -> C/C++ -> Paths and Symbols, add freeRTOS
{drivers, board, source, utilities, startup, freertos/include, freertos/portable}
Also need to add source directory under properties
Also add under C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Includes
(needed to add freeRTOS 3 places to get included)

Library Redlib
