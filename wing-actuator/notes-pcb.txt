Notes on PCB design for micromiror drive

July 8, 2018
need to add modular_pcb.lbr to Eagle directories.
Tried File-open-> libary, but can't edit symbol or contents

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle#using-the-sparkfun-libraries


Eagle: header for connector, 3M has walled header
pinhead directory has double row headers
pinhd-2x4

move objects:
1) select group
2) select move
3) ctrl-right to move
4) left to place

libraries: control panel: options: directories :browse

Errata and changes from July 2018 PCB
1) BOM: X5 should be vertical, not horizontal to avoid mounting hole H5.
2) DRC: supply pin overwritten 3v3. Was previously output from Arduino board, but now is local.
3) DRC: 15V on D1, D3, D4, D5 too close to collector and arcs. (Was only 30 mils)

Simplify board design. 
Assume:
1) voltage will be fixed function of PWM. (Not clear how much capacitance changes with position).
2) Assume capacitive sensing will be included, e.g. using ADA2200 synch demodulator. So analog circuitry can be for 
cap sensing and multiplexing as needed.

LT3468 photoflash + ATB3225 transformer?

how to import .bxl library into Eagle?
https://www.ultralibrarian.com/products/free-reader
download free reader for ultralibrarian
exported to C:\ultralibrarian\library\exported\eagle
In control panel, select use lt3468.lbr
\\proj20\Fearing\home\ronf\research\development\modular_robotics_pcb\common\lbr
use all directory
opened library part, now seen in avialable parts, but did not add any part to schematic.
Library->Manage Devices -> Add Symbol, then new package to add package (need to match pins)

In part editor: prefix u; to automatically add prefix
adding attribute to parts:
attr D20 digikey 'DA2JF8100LCT-ND' ;
hard to change every part- put in library and then do replace?

How do I change the properties of several objects at once?

command: change width 8 mil, then left click mouse on line

Adding part to KiCAD
https://app.ultralibrarian.com/content/help/

parts look for R, C to find caps and resistors
Added digikey kicad parts library
