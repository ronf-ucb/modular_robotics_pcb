Bringing up tactile sensor on K64F
July 10, 2019

1. How to get pins screen to see package?
right click on project name -> MCUXpresso config tools -> pins
(can not click directly on pins tab- gives blank)

2. What is maximum baud rate?
64 x 4 char (3 digits + space) = 256 char * 200 Hz = 50kByte/sec = 400 kbaud
K64F tech ref manual:52.4.2.9 Baud rate tolerance 
MAx baud rate = UART clock /16

drivers/fsl_uart.h initializes to 115200

Quick Settings -> SDK Debug Console
PRINTF?
Advanced settings: C/C++ Library Settings -> Redirect SDK PRINTF
(not sure how this can be done once project is already installed)
#define BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE 9600 
and then use 
UART_Init(UART0, &config, DEMO_UART_CLK_FREQ);
(DEMO_UART_CLK_FREQ is defined in CLOCK_GetFreq(UART0_CLK_SRC)
pyserial: Standard values above 115200, such as: 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000,
921600, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, 4000000
 also work on many platforms and devices.
 
 Changed BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE to 230400: ok.
 1152000 is garbled
 1000000 works ok on putty
 
 3. Analog input range:
 VAIO Analog1, RESET, EXTAL, and XTAL input voltage –0.3 VDD + 0.3 V
 
 4. IO connections:
 use J6 on K64F, 8 pin connections
 
 5. how to enable floating point and printing?
 Quickstart -> Quick Settings -> Set Floating Point type
 Hard ABI (pass floating point in registers)
 
 5.1  Quick Settings→Set Library Header type→NewlibNano (semihost)
 5.2  NewlibNano:   If  your  codebase  does  require  floating  point  variants  of printf/scanf, 
 then these can be enabled by going to:
 •Project→Properties→C/C++ Build→Settings→MCU Linker→Managed  Linker  Script 
 and  selecting  the  ”Enable  printf/scanf float” tick box.
 
 6. Timing is off, are clocks set same as race-timer?
 Maybe UART baudrate changed timing?
