Bringing up tactile sensor on K64F
July 10, 2019

1. How to get pins screen to see package?
right click on project name -> MCUXpresso config tools -> pins
(can not click directly on pins tab- gives blank)

2. What is maximum baud rate?
64 x 4 char (3 digits + space) = 256 char * 200 Hz = 50kByte/sec = 400 kbaud
K64F tech ref manual:52.4.2.9 Baud rate tolerance 
MAx baud rate = UART clock /16

drivers/fsl_uart.h initializes to 115200

Quick Settings -> SDK Debug Console
PRINTF?
Advanced settings: C/C++ Library Settings -> Redirect SDK PRINTF
(not sure how this can be done once project is already installed)
#define BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE 9600 
and then use 
UART_Init(UART0, &config, DEMO_UART_CLK_FREQ);
(DEMO_UART_CLK_FREQ is defined in CLOCK_GetFreq(UART0_CLK_SRC)
pyserial: Standard values above 115200, such as: 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000,
921600, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, 4000000
 also work on many platforms and devices.
 
 Changed BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE to 230400: ok.
 1152000 is garbled
 1000000 works ok on putty
 
 3. Analog input range:
 VAIO Analog1, RESET, EXTAL, and XTAL input voltage –0.3 VDD + 0.3 V
 
 4. IO connections:
 use J6 on K64F, 8 pin connections
 
 5. how to enable floating point and printing?
 Quickstart -> Quick Settings -> Set Floating Point type
 Hard ABI (pass floating point in registers)
 
 5.1  Quick Settings→Set Library Header type→NewlibNano (semihost)
 5.2  NewlibNano:   If  your  codebase  does  require  floating  point  variants  of printf/scanf, 
 then these can be enabled by going to:
 •Project→Properties→C/C++ Build→Settings→MCU Linker→Managed  Linker  Script 
 and  selecting  the  ”Enable  printf/scanf float” tick box.
 maybe also PRINTF_FLOAT_ENABLE=1?
 CR_INTEGER_PRINTF - Undefine/Remove this directive
 
 6. Timing is off, are clocks set same as race-timer?
 Maybe UART baudrate changed timing? Needed to change FreeRTOSConfig.h
 
 7. Using A/D in software triggered mode.
 Ref manual p. 847, chap 35
 Copy example from k64_adc
 missing BOARD_INITPINS_ADC0_SE12_GPIO_PIN- need to set _Identifier_ in pin config tool!
 (can not leave blank- then will not generate code.)
 
 8. How does getchar work? semiconsole or UART? 
 use GETCHAR? Seems to hang in GETCHAR. need to debug reading a character.
 PUTCHAR and GETCHAR work, but SCANF does not echo, and terminates on space, not <cr>
 scanf went right to hardfault on single-step, maybe not linked in?
 
 9. can't see tactile_project when loading into mcuxpresso on haydn? Something with .cproject or .project?
 These look identical. May need to just recreate project?
 Or export as archive and reimport? But want to use github for compatability...
 maybe .settings?
 
 can't open project Tactile, but can open Tactile1?
 
 try just copying an existing directory into its own location, w/o workspace?
 worked ok for RaceTimer3. 
 Tried copying tactile_project: Source Path Too Long: org.eclipse.egit.core.
 Now opens ok, since this file was not copied. Is .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.projects needed?
 Try deleting ./metadata directory.
 
 
 
 
 9. if project won't open, try deleting .metadata directory
 
 10. log task not running, since tactile_task is higher priority and did not yield.
 /* configUSE_IDLE_HOOK must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for the idle hook function to get called. */
 Log works after terminating getchar loop
 
 11. smartgit would not stage/add file even after deleting lock file. Copy files to new repo and make new MCUXpresso project.
 Project name: Tactile_Project
 OS-> freertos
